# Iris_Classification_using_Machine-Learning
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify the Iris flower dataset, a classic and simple dataset commonly used for testing algorithms. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one of three classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
