# Iris_Classification_using_Machine-Learning
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify the Iris flower dataset, a classic and simple dataset commonly used for testing algorithms. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one of three classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).    

**Introduction**   
The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species using their physical characteristics. We will explore and compare different machine learning models to find the most effective one for this classification task.   

**Dataset**   
The Iris dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is included in this project. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features:

Sepal Length   
Sepal Width   
Petal Length   
Petal Width   

*Each sample belongs to one of three classes:*

Iris-setosa   
Iris-versicolor   
Iris-virginica   

**Algorithms Used**   
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared in this project:

Logistic Regression   
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)   
Support Vector Machines (SVM)   
Naive Bayes   
Decision Tree
